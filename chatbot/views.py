   - When and how to retest after adjustments
   - Alternative treatment options if primary chemicals aren't available

6. **Professional Insights and Best Practices**:
   - How current levels will trend over time with normal use
   - Environmental factors affecting these readings (weather, bather load, etc.)
   - Preventive maintenance to avoid future imbalances
   - Signs to watch for indicating water chemistry changes
   - Seasonal considerations and adjustments
   - Equipment maintenance that affects water chemistry

7. **Testing and Monitoring Guidance**:
   - Limitations of test strip readings vs digital testing
   - When to use professional testing services
   - Recommended testing frequency for each parameter
   - How to improve test strip accuracy (timing, lighting, technique)
   - Backup testing methods and cross-verification

8. **Additional Professional Guidance**:
   - Pool maintenance schedule recommendations
   - Chemical storage and safety tips
   - When to consult pool professionals
   - Common mistakes to avoid
   - Cost-effective maintenance strategies

**Water Quality Standards:**
- pH: 7.2-7.6 (optimal), 7.0-7.8 (acceptable)
- Free Chlorine: 1.0-3.0 mg/L (ppm)
- Total Alkalinity: 80-120 mg/L (ppm)
- Cyanuric Acid: 30-50 mg/L (ppm)

**IMPORTANT**: Provide detailed, educational explanations for every recommendation. Users want to understand not just WHAT to do, but WHY they need to do it, HOW to do it properly, and WHEN to expect results. Make responses comprehensive and informative, treating each analysis as a complete professional consultation.

Always prioritize swimmer safety and provide thorough, actionable advice with complete explanations.'''
